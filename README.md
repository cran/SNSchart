# Sequential Normal Scores

The methods discussed in this package are new nonparametric methods
based on *sequential normal scores* (SNS), designed for sequences of
observations, usually time series data, which may occur singly or in
batches, and may be univariate or multivariate. These methods are
designed to detect changes in the process, which may occur as changes in
*location* (mean or median), changes in *scale* (standard deviation, or
variance), or other changes of interest in the distribution of the
observations, over the time observed. They usually apply to large data
sets, so computations need to be simple enough to be done in a
reasonable time on a computer, and easily updated as each new
observation (or batch of observations) becomes available.

## Installation

You can install the released version of SNS from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("SNSchart")
```

or install from the package hosted in
[github](https://github.com/LuisBenavides/SNSchart).

``` r
install_github("LuisBenavides/SNSchart")
```

**Note**: To use `install_github` it is needed the library devtools.
\#\# Univariate Analysis

### Using SNS function

The reference sample `Y` and the monitoring sample `X`.

``` r
Y = c(10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100)
X = c(30, 35, 45)
```

#### Example of conditionsl SNS with a reference sample `Y`

``` r
Y = c(10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100)
X = c(30, 35, 45)
theta = 40
Ftheta = 0.5
sample.id = c("a", "b", "c")
SNS(X = X, X.id = sample.id, Y = Y, theta = theta, Ftheta = Ftheta)
```
